# Podversation (voice interface) Workshop
What this is:
This is a prototype example for a voice interface.

What this covers
- Get microphone input.
- Convert speech audio to text. (API layer)
- Work with different types of voice processingâ€“push to talk vs. always listening.
- Do something with the text, e.g., trigger commands
- BONUS* make it look good and useful


## Local Project setup
Install prerequisites for your machine, or use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) See [Running in Docker](#Docker-setup)

### Prerequisites
- Code Editor, I love [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Vue Cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)

Install the Vue Cli with:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli @vue/cli-service-global
```

## Run Locally
```
npm run serve
```
For the purposes of local development, we'll be using the vue server from the Vue Cli.


## Docker setup
With Docker Desktop installed (or [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) for older Windows or Windows 10 Home), build the docker image and start the development server with
```
docker-compose up
```

### Launching the Docker containers interactive shell.
If you need to access the running container to run other `npm` scripts or similar, first you will need the container ID, then you can connect to it with `docker exec`, ex:
Get the image NAME with
```shell
docker ps

# CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
f7411a6d2e0e        podversation_vue    "npm run serve"     2 hours ago         Up 7 minutes        0.0.0.0:8080->8080
```
then attach with:
```shell
docker exec -it [container name] /bin/ash
```
You can exit the conainer with `ctrl+p, q` (in succession, `p` then `q` while holding `ctrl`)

# Chapter 1 - Podcast player
The key feature of this application is to be able to listen to voice commands while listening to a podcast, in order to get there, we'll first hook up a basic audio file player.

## Podcast data
We're mocking data that we would get back from a backend service or some other component.
See, the new file, `src/data/podcast-data.js`.

We'll be referencing a podcast episode from this dataset. The first option, `podcasts[0]` is a streamed audio file from Libsyn, the second, `podcasts[1]` is a local mp3 file in `public/assets/`

## Todo's
This part of the prototype is simply getting the basics of a UI built for presentation and setting us up for the next step with a couple custom UI elements with event methods attached to them.

- Build UI with Podcast image, title, episode name, and description (in `components/PodcastPlayer.vue`)
- Create a new `Controls` component in `components/Controls.vue`
    - Create a custom Controls UI with a seekbar, timestamps, and play button.
- Add basic event handling to the new Controls component for, `play()`


# Chapter 2 - Speech to text API
The key component to our prototype is getting voice input and listening to that input for commands. There are a handful of services that are all good, for this one, we'll be using [Artyom](https://github.com/sdkcarlos/artyom.js). It is Open Source, can listen to a stream for commands, and doesn't require an API call. Build on the [WebkitSpeechRecognition API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API), **Only available in Chrome**


## Todo's
- New Artyom based VoiceInterface class
    - Add an instance to `App.vue`
    - Add a play command to play the podcast (*hint, access grandchild component through `$refs`)

- Listen for "bookmark" and "new note" commands
    - `console.log()` for now

### Snippets
Artyom Settings
```js
{
    lang: 'en-US', // Language to listen for
    continuous: true, // Listen forever
    soundex: true, // Use the soundex algorithm to increase accuracy
    debug: true, // Show messages in the console
    listen: true, // Start to listen commands !

    // If providen, you can only trigger a command if you say its name
    // e.g to trigger Good Morning, you need to say 'Jarvis Good Morning'
    // name: 'Jarvis'
}
```
